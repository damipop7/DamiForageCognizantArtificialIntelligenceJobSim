# DamiForageCognizantArtificialIntelligenceJobSim

This is an Artificial Intelligence Job simulation in collaboration with Cognizant on Forage. 

In this project, I completed 5 tasks using Artificial Intelligence in real-world experience. 
<h1> Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis </h1>
In this task, I learned how to explore a client's sales data as part of the Data Science team at Cognizant. I learned this using a Google Colab notebook and Python to explore Gala Groceriesâ€™ data. After exploring the data, I communicated my findings and recommendations to the Data Science Team Leader. 

<h1> Task 2: Data Modeling </h1>
In this task, I developed an understanding of relational data and how to frame problem statements. I reviewed a data model diagram provided by the Data Engineering team and created a strategic plan using the data to answer the problem statement. I also summarized the choices and plan of work in a PowerPoint presentation. 

<h1> Task 3: Model Building and Interpretation </h1>
In this task, i learnt how to build a predictive model using sample data and i got more experience with python interpreters and Google Colab. I combined, trnasformed and modelled 3 datasets to ansswer the problem statement and communicated my work and analysis in a Powerpoint. 

<h1>Task 4: </h1>
